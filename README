#      	  Imports: spectrum data from Schearer 2002 from a list of input parameters.
#	  Outputs: wavelength, flux and age data
#	  Optional parameters: Model input parameters: e.g. mass loss, imf (mass upper/lower), option to plot graph of spectra

# File 2: import_emission_lines.py
#      	  Imports: emission line data from Schaerer 2002 from a list of input paeameters matching that of import_spectrum.py
#	  Outputs: Full spectrum data including emission lines, option to plot spectra
